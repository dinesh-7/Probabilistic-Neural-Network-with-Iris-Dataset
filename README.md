# Probabilistic-Neural-Network-with-Iris-Dataset
We tried implementing the Probabilistic Neural Network  in Iris Dataset and we successfully implemented and we need to give the Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal Length, Petal Width to our predictor after running the cells it will give you which class the given sample data belongs to.
